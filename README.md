# Chronicles of Valor
Chronicles of Valor is a Python terminal text-based adventure game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can explore the world of Cydoia in this Jack and the Beanstalk inspired adventure, playing as their favorite class between a Fighter, Rogue or a Wizard. Every class has specific and unique available choices with wich the user can shape the story as they like.

# How to play
Chonicles of Valor is based on the classic 80s text-based games, and it introduces the flourishing continent of Cydoia, rich of adventures.

The user will be introduce to the adventure and asked for their name. The user can input any name, as long as there are no numbers in it and they input at least one character. The user will then be able to choose their prefered class to play as. To do so they will have to input the number of their choice to the program. After that, the adventure will begin and the user just has to continue inputting the number of their choices and see how the story changes and shapes based on their choices.

The story is completely original made by myself, highly inspired by the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and the popular TTRPG Dungeons & Dragons for the Wizard spells.

The game offers unique choices based on the class the user chose and different options also have a random outcome to them, allowing for replayability for possible different outcomes to the story.

The game has many endings, some that are bad and quickly available, some that let's the user win the game.
